Components of the Code:
Canvas Setup:

A Canvas object is created to visualize the game. This allows drawing the field and players.

Player Class:

* Represents each player in the game.
* Properties:
    * x, y: Position on the field.
    * has_ball: Indicates if the player has possession of the ball.
    * role: Defines the player's role (attacker, defender, or defending_goalie).
    * side: Indicates which side the player belongs to.
    * color: Determines the visual color for each role.
* Methods:
    * move(dx, dy): Updates the player's position.
    * get_position() and get_has_ball(): Retrieve player state.
    * set_has_ball(has_ball): Updates the possession state.

Ball Class:

Represents the ball in the game.
* Properties:
    * x, y: Position on the field.
    * direction: Placeholder for the ball's movement direction.
    * speed_max: Maximum speed of the ball.
* Methods:
    *move(dx, dy): Updates the ball's position.

Game Logic:

* distance_point_to_line: Calculates the perpendicular distance of a point from a line, used for interception logic.
* game_dt(players, ball, dt): Simulates the game's logic for one time step (dt):
* Attackers:
    * If an attacker has the ball, they move towards the goal.
    * If they don't, they move towards a target position but can't pass defenders.
* Defenders:
    * Attempt to intercept the ball using perpendicular movement relative to the ball's trajectory.
    * Adjust their movement based on the distance to the ball.

* The ball's position is synchronized with the player holding it.

Visualization:

* drawField(canvas): (Assumed function) Draws the soccer field.
* draw_player(canvas, x, y, has_ball, color): (Assumed function) Draws players on the field.
* The game state is updated in a loop, and the canvas is refreshed to display the new state.
Simulation:

A loop runs for 20 iterations, simulating the game and updating player and ball positions. It visualizes the field and players at each step with a slight delay (sleep(0.04)).

Purpose:
This code simulates a basic soccer scenario where attackers move towards the goal, defenders attempt to intercept the ball, and the game state updates in real-time with visualization.
Assumptions:
Some functions like set_random_positions, drawField, and draw_player are placeholders or defined elsewhere, providing randomness and rendering functionality.
